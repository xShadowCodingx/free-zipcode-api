<h1>This is still in development</h1>
<p>But this is still a public API that is free to use, copy, fork, etc.</p>

<h3>If you find any issues, or want to contribute to this project let me know. I plan to leave this open-source so everyone has access.</h3>
<p>I plan on utilizing PostGRES on vercel, however for now I will be pulling the information from the JSON file in the data folder</p>

<ul>
    <li>Get all information: /get-all-info</li>
    <li>Get city, state, zip: /search?by=city-state-zip</li>
</ul>
